# **An analysis on election results for three US counties.**

## Overview of Election Audit
### **Purpose of the audit**
The purpose of this audit was to assist a Colorado board of elections employee in an election audit of the voting results for a U.S. congressional precinct in that state. This audit was performed using **Python** and the goal was to report the following: 
* Total number of votes for each candidate
* Percentage of votes for each candidate
* Winner of the election based on the popular vote
* Total number of votes for each county
* County with the largest turnout

## Election-Audit Results
The results were calculated using different features in Python. The following analysis will provide a more detailed account of the audit process: 

* **Total number of votes for the congressional election**:
The total number of votes for the election was 369, 711. This was calculated using a **for loop**, which helped us iterate through each row in the election_results.csv file, adding a vote for each row in it. The code we used is as follows:


* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

* Which county had the largest number of votes?
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Election-Audit Summary

In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
